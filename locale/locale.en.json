        "title": "About",
        "summary": "Full Stack Developer with practical experience in Backend, Frontend, and Artificial Intelligence projects. I work on all stages of development — from conception to delivery — creating complete, scalable, and high-performance applications. Passionate about innovation and continuous learning, I seek to combine a broad view of the technological ecosystem with a focus on efficiency, quality, and creative solutions that generate real impact.",
        "story_title": "My Story",
        "story_p1": "My journey began at my family's metallurgical company, where I learned early on the value of work, responsibility, and innovation. My interest in technology emerged young, during robotics classes, and solidified when I enrolled in the Technical Electronics course at Fundação Liberato, where I engaged in practical projects and led study groups that boosted collective performance.",
        "story_p2": "While studying, I worked as a waiter in the summers and selling snacks on the street during the year, experiences that reinforced my resilience, discipline, and communication skills. Due to the pandemic, the course completion was delayed, but I finished my training in 2022, right after the return of in-person classes.",
        "story_p3": "During this period, I interned at Pramel Equipamentos Eletrônicos, working on embedded firmware development and circuit and electronic board projects, always delivering results above expectations for quality and speed in deliveries.",
        "story_p4": "After the internship, I returned to the family company, this time leading production and creating new products, applying my technical knowledge to optimize processes and add value to the business. In parallel, I worked as a freelancer, developing web applications and custom solutions for small businesses, in addition to participating in bootcamps in Backend, Frontend, and Artificial Intelligence.",
        "story_p5": "In 2024, I joined Integrum Inteligência Industrial ERP, where I started in technical support and quickly evolved to junior programmer. Even with little time learning Delphi, I began to actively contribute to system maintenance and improvement, fixing bugs, proposing solutions, and developing new features with direct impact on the company's performance.",
        "story_p6": "Currently, I continue to improve as a full stack developer, focusing on creating efficient, scalable, and results-oriented solutions. I am a Computer Science student (in progress, expected completion in 2028) and maintain a self-taught posture, learning continuously and applying knowledge directly to my projects and professional practice.",

I remain calm in the face of challenges and value innovative solutions that bring real impact.",
        "personality_p2": "Outside of work, I balance this rational side with traits of empathy and sensitivity. I am attentive to people, concerned with listening and understanding different perspectives, which strengthens teamwork. I feel more engaged when everyone is aligned, dreaming of the best for the project, dedicated, and willing to give their all. I value brainstorming moments, where each idea is collectively improved, making projects more solid and innovative.",
        "personality_p3": "I have as constant motivation <em>automating tasks, creating striking designs, and delivering results I can be proud of</em>. Dedication, innovation, healthy perfectionism, and ambition are among my main marks. My tendency to imagine future scenarios allows me to <strong>anticipate risks, identify improvement points, and prepare solutions before problems arise</strong>, turning planning into a differential.",
        "hobbies_title": "My Hobbies",
        "hobbies_p1": "I am passionate about reading, exploring from science and science fiction to fantasy, suspense, and romance.

No one knows everything, and those who think they have reached the top have just stopped evolving. I, on the contrary, live in search of learning. This is my incessant flame. My dreamy passion for technology makes me want not just to write code, but to expand the limits of what it can do, take technology to new levels, transform ideas into intelligent and useful realities.",
